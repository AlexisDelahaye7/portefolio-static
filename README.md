## Introduction

I'm using Astro as the front-end static framework as I wanted to experiment a lighter and quicker to load alternative to React as well as keeping the components approach.
The current style sheet language used is SASS (SCSS syntax) but I'm still working on getting the most of it and developping an alternative with plain CSS to help the page load faster.
